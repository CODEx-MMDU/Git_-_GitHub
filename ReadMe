Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**, meaning it tracks changes in computer files and allows collaboration among developers working on the same project. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

**What it does:**

* **Tracks changes:** Git keeps a history of all changes made to a project's files, allowing you to see who made what changes and when.
* **Collaboration:**  Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other.
* **Versioning:** Git allows you to revert back to any previous version of your project if something goes wrong.
* **Efficiency:** Compared to older methods, Git uses efficient storage techniques to avoid redundant data storage.

**How it works:**

* **Snapshots:** Instead of storing changes between versions, Git takes "snapshots" of the project's entire state at specific points, known as commits.
* **Local repository:** Each developer has a complete copy of the project history on their local machine, making collaboration easier even without constant internet access.
* **Central repository (optional):** Projects can also have a central repository (often called a "remote") hosted online, allowing developers to share their changes and work together seamlessly.

**Benefits:**

* **History tracking:** Provides a clear picture of how the project evolved over time.
* **Collaboration:** Streamlines teamwork by avoiding conflicts and confusion.
* **Security:** Allows reverting to previous versions if errors are introduced.
* **Scalability:** Handles large and complex projects efficiently.

**Popularity:**

Git is the **most popular version control system** in the world, widely used in software development, but also applicable to other file-based projects like documentation or design assets.

Remember, this is a simplified explanation. Git can be quite complex, but understanding these core concepts will give you a good starting point.
